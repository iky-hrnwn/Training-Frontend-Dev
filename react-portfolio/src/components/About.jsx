            Graduated in Multimedia at Telkom University with a strong passion for web and app development, I initially wanted to pursue a career in game development, but due to certain limitations, I decided to focus on becoming a Web Developer first. With a deep interest in technology, I am committed to continuous learning until I master various areas of programming.
